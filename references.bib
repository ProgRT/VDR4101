abstract = {Objectives: In select burn intensive care units, high-frequency percussive ventilation is preferentially used to provide mechanical ventilation in support of patients with acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and inhalation injury. However, we found an absence of prospective studies comparing high-frequency percussive ventilation with contemporary low-tidal volume ventilation strategies. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the two ventilator modalities in a burn intensive care unit setting. Design: Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, comparing high-frequency percussive ventilation with low-tidal volume ventilation in patients admitted to our burn intensive care unit with respiratory failure. Setting: A 16-bed burn intensive care unit at a tertiary military teaching hospital. Patients: Adult patients ?18 yrs of age requiring prolonged ({\textgreater}24 hrs) mechanical ventilation were admitted to the burn intensive care unit. The study was conducted over a 3-yr period between April 2006 and May 2009. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00351741. Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ventilation through a high-frequency percussive ventilation-based strategy (n = 31) or a low-tidal volume ventilation-based strategy (n = 31). Measurements and main results: At baseline, both the high-frequency percussive ventilation group and the low-tidal volume ventilation group had similar demographics to include median age (interquartile range) (28 yrs [23-45] vs. 33 yrs [24-46], p = nonsignificant), percentage of total body surface area burn (34 [20-52] vs. 34 [23-50], p = nonsignificant), and clinical diagnosis of inhalation injury (39{\%} vs. 35{\%}, p = nonsignificant). The primary outcome was ventilator-free days in the first 28 days after randomization. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed no significant difference between the high-frequency percussive ventilation and the low-tidal volume ventilation groups in mean (? sd) ventilator-free days (12 ? 9 vs. 11 ? 9, p = nonsignificant). No significant difference was detected between groups for any of the secondary outcome measures to include mortality except the need for "rescue" mode application (p =.02). Nine (29{\%}) in the low-tidal volume ventilation arm did not meet predetermined oxygenation or ventilation goals and required transition to a rescue mode. By contrast, two in the high-frequency percussive ventilation arm (6{\%}) required rescue. Conclusions: A high-frequency percussive ventilation-based strategy resulted in similar clinical outcomes when compared with a low-tidal volume ventilation-based strategy in burn patients with respiratory failure. However, the low-tidal volume ventilation strategy failed to achieve ventilation and oxygenation goals in a higher percentage necessitating rescue ventilation. ? 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

@article{Reper2002,
abstract = {Inhalation injury and bacterial pneumonia represent some of the most important causes of mortality in burn patients. Thirty-five severely burned patients were randomised on admission for conventional ventilation (CV; control group) versus high frequency percussive ventilation (HFPV; study group). HFPV is a ventilatory mode, introduced 10 years ago which combines the advantages of CV with some of those of high frequency ventilation. Arterial blood gases, ventilatory and hemodynamic variables were recorded for 5 days at 2h intervals. Incident complications were classically managed. A statistical analysis (Student's t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test) demonstrated a significant higher PaO2/FiO2 from days 0 to 3 in the HFPV group. No significant differences were observed for the other parameters. Our findings suggest that HFPV can improve blood oxygenation during the acute phase following inhalation injury allowing reduction of FiO2. No significant differences were observed between groups for mortality nor incidence of infectious complications in this study. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and ISBI.
