abstract = {Objectives: In select burn intensive care units, high-frequency percussive ventilation is preferentially used to provide mechanical ventilation in support of patients with acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and inhalation injury. However, we found an absence of prospective studies comparing high-frequency percussive ventilation with contemporary low-tidal volume ventilation strategies. The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the two ventilator modalities in a burn intensive care unit setting. Design: Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, comparing high-frequency percussive ventilation with low-tidal volume ventilation in patients admitted to our burn intensive care unit with respiratory failure. Setting: A 16-bed burn intensive care unit at a tertiary military teaching hospital. Patients: Adult patients ?18 yrs of age requiring prolonged ({\textgreater}24 hrs) mechanical ventilation were admitted to the burn intensive care unit. The study was conducted over a 3-yr period between April 2006 and May 2009. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00351741. Interventions: Subjects were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ventilation through a high-frequency percussive ventilation-based strategy (n = 31) or a low-tidal volume ventilation-based strategy (n = 31). Measurements and main results: At baseline, both the high-frequency percussive ventilation group and the low-tidal volume ventilation group had similar demographics to include median age (interquartile range) (28 yrs [23-45] vs. 33 yrs [24-46], p = nonsignificant), percentage of total body surface area burn (34 [20-52] vs. 34 [23-50], p = nonsignificant), and clinical diagnosis of inhalation injury (39{\%} vs. 35{\%}, p = nonsignificant). The primary outcome was ventilator-free days in the first 28 days after randomization. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed no significant difference between the high-frequency percussive ventilation and the low-tidal volume ventilation groups in mean (? sd) ventilator-free days (12 ? 9 vs. 11 ? 9, p = nonsignificant). No significant difference was detected between groups for any of the secondary outcome measures to include mortality except the need for "rescue" mode application (p =.02). Nine (29{\%}) in the low-tidal volume ventilation arm did not meet predetermined oxygenation or ventilation goals and required transition to a rescue mode. By contrast, two in the high-frequency percussive ventilation arm (6{\%}) required rescue. Conclusions: A high-frequency percussive ventilation-based strategy resulted in similar clinical outcomes when compared with a low-tidal volume ventilation-based strategy in burn patients with respiratory failure. However, the low-tidal volume ventilation strategy failed to achieve ventilation and oxygenation goals in a higher percentage necessitating rescue ventilation. ? 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Acute respiratory failure (ARF) following trauma or sepsis has a mortality rate of 50{\%} to 85{\%}. The mainstays of treatment are mechanical ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In the past decade, many reports have claimed superiority of high frequency ventilation (HFV) in the treatment of ARF. We structured a prospective randomized trial of HFV versus conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) in the treatment of acute respiratory failure. All patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) were eligible for the study. On admission patients identified for being at risk of developing acute respiratory failure were randomized to receive either HFV or CMV. Patients were treated to the same therapeutic endpoint (pH greater than 7.35, PaCO2 35 to 45 torr, PaO2/FIO2 greater than 225). Daily ventilatory support, fluid and drug requirements, and cardiopulmonary variables were recorded. One hundred thirteen patients were entered into the study. Of these, 100 completed the study (HFV n = 52, CMV n = 48) and 60 developed acute respiratory failure (HFV n = 32, CMV n = 28). Patients on HFV reached the therapeutic endpoint at a lower level of continuous positive airway pressure and mean airway pressure; however there were no differences in mortality, SICU days, hospital days, incidence of barotrauma, number of blood gases, or cardiovascular interventions. This report suggests that HFV offers no concrete advantages over CMV when applied in a prospective fashion for the treatment of acute respiratory failure.},

@article{Pillow2005,
abstract = {The mechanisms governing gas flow, gas mixing, and pressure transmission during high-frequency oscillatory ventila-tion (HFOV) are fundamentally different to ventilation at more conventional respi-ratory breathing frequencies. They are in-tegrally related to each other through the prevailing mechanical characteristics of the intubated respiratory system and fre-quency, symmetry, and magnitude of the applied pressure waveform. An apprecia-tion of these mechanisms, and their im-plications for gas mixing efficiency, and the appropriate selection and matching of ventilator settings to the mechanical properties of the intubated respiratory system represent essential knowledge foundations for the clinician who uses HFOV to treat respiratory disease in the adult. This article aims to summarize the known mechanisms of gas mixing and to discuss the impact of lung mechanics on pressure transmission, flow generation, and the efficiency of ventilation and how each of these interact with each other during HFOV. A brief overview of the practical difficulties and progress achieved to date in measuring lung me-chanics during HFOV is given and the relevance of measuring lung mechanics to optimization of clinical application of HFOV in acute respiratory distress syn-drome (ARDS) is reviewed.},
